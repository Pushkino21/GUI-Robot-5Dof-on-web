# GUI-Robot-5Dof-on-web
This is an attempt to merge a flask app with robotic kinematics to ensure a better, flexible and portable controls and visualizations
To use it you might need to install flask, socketio, numpy and run it into a Raspberry pi board, also if you dont have one you only need to bypass the module send and will run on any kind of pc that runs python.
Furthermore this is only a version, over the next i'll will add the function to use remote GPIO
